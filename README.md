> **Goal:** Develop a state-of-the-art deep learning model for lung cancer nodule detection using annotated CT images

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for detecting lung nodules in CT scans, comparing naive baselines, Random Forest, and advanced 3D CNNs with interactive Streamlit dashboard for early lung cancer screening support.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Objective:** Detecting lung nodules (potential tumors) in CT scans to support early lung cancer screening using the LUNA16 dataset.

**Challenge:** This is a critical medical imaging task with extreme class imbalance (99.8% negative samples) requiring high sensitivity while minimizing false positives. Early detection of lung nodules can significantly improve patient outcomes in lung cancer treatment.

**Target:** Achieve FROC Score > 0.85 for competitive lung nodule detection performance.

## 📚 Literature Review & Previous Efforts

### **LUNA16 Challenge Background**
- **Competition Period:** 2016-2018 (officially closed due to methodological issues)
- **Evaluation Method:** ANODE09-style FROC analysis reflecting real-world diagnostic performance
- **Top Performance:** First place achieved 0.951 FROC score using 3D Feature Pyramid Networks

### **Benchmark Standards (Song et al, 2024)**
- **State-of-the-art systems:** FROC > 0.90
- **Competitive research systems:** FROC 0.8-0.9  
- **Basic approaches:** FROC < 0.80

### **Winning Approach Analysis**
**1st Place: Ping An Technology (2018)**
- 3DCNN for Lung Nodule Detection and False Positive Reduction
- 3D Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) inspired by Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017
- Multi-scale prediction across pyramid levels for various nodule sizes
- Focal loss for class imbalance handling

## 🔬 Model Evaluation Process & Metrics

### **Primary Metric: FROC (Free-Response Operating Characteristic)**
- **Definition:** Measures sensitivity vs. average false positives per scan
- **Clinical Relevance:** More aligned with real-world diagnostic performance than ROC
- **Advantage:** Captures trade-off between detecting nodules and reducing false alarms
- **Localization:** Hit criterion based on nodule size (R=diameter/2)

### **Why FROC over Traditional Metrics:**

| Metric | Typical Usage | Limitations in Lung Nodule Detection |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Accuracy | Simple Classification | Fails with class imbalance, no false positive info |
| Precision/Recall | Detection/Classification | Doesn't consider spatial detection info |
| ROC AUC | Object Detection | Doesn't reflect per-scan false positive burden |
| **FROC + Avg Sensitivity** | **CAD & Radiology** | **Tailored for medical image detection** |

### **Evaluation Protocol**
- ANODE09-style evaluation using FROC analysis
- Localized hit criteria adapting to actual nodule size
- Focus on clinically relevant false positive rates

## 🧠 Modeling Approach

```
📊 Three-Model Comparison Pipeline:
├── 1️⃣ Naive Baseline (Coordinate Heuristics)
├── 2️⃣ Random Forest (Enhanced Features)

```

### **1. Naive Baseline Model**
```python
# Simple coordinate-based heuristics

- Robust scaling and preprocessing
- FROC: 0.0429
- Purpose: Traditional ML baseline
```

### **3. 3D CNN (Deep Learning) - Best Performer**
```python
# Simple Effective Architecture (21,985 parameters)

- FROC: 0.2857 ⭐
```

### **Deep Learning Strategy Components:**
